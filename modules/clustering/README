Clustering1 documentation

    Clustering1 contains the main clustering operation, called mainClustering, which takes an array of tweet objects.
    Due to the nature of the callback functions and AlchemyAPI, it can't simply return the result, which will be a, array of cluster objects.
    At the moment it simply prints it to console (on line 58). 
    If something else is to be done with it (i.e. another callback) then that would have to be added to the argument of tweetChooser (on line 32, and line 201), then instead of printing to console the callback could be called on result3 to send it somewhere else.

    a cluster object has the following parameters:
        tweets: array of tweets
        centroid: array of size 15 which represents the average of all the tweets represented as vectors over the vector space of words
        words: array of keyWords (from alchemyAPI documentation), each of which has 2 parameters 
                        text :: string, which is the text
                        relevance :: string which is the numerical relevance (between 0-1) but in string form. if wanted in float form just call relevance.parseFloat() to get is as a number
                    
    every cluster in the result should have the same words array, but will of course have different centroids and tweets. it is possible if there are very few tweets, that a cluster ends up with no tweets. if this would cause a problem just check the size of cluster.tweets, and if 0 splice it out of the array.
