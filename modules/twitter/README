To search for tweets use: Twitter.searchTweets (this only works for a maximum of
100 returned tweets; will implement in the future a methods which will return more)

for a tweet.

User.js contains the definition of a User. Each tweet contains an object of type
User representing the user that posted that tweet.

Trend.js contains the definition of a Trend object. An object of this type is 
returned when accessing the trending page from Twitter.
